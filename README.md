Inspired by https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/readmes/andras-horvath/, customized for myself (a backend engineer).

## Dao Van Manh's README
Hi, I'm Dao Van Manh. Please call me "Dao" for short. I'm living at Tokyo, Japan.

In previous decade, I had worked as a backend engineer in (mostly) Japanese companies, where I focused on Fintech domain, especially payment systems. I have a passion for creating clean architectures and making things work (then making people happy).

This page describes the most efficient ways to work with me. Please feel free to contribute to it by opening a pull request.

## Values
I moved into backend because I care that things submitted from clients can be verified, modified and worked here. That means I have to understand the business logics, and the big picture of the whole system as well.

I value openness, ownership, and trust, and I will give you mine.
- For openness, I value and welcome diversity of thought, and not all ideas need to be good ones either. We're still all better off discussing them than not.
- For ownership, I believe that ownership makes us to think about the work carefully, and take the quick action without hesitance.
- For trust, I believe that only trust can makes us work together in long time. The relationship bases on trust are very solid, and it demands both to believe in each others.

## My communication style
I'm striving for honest yet caring discussions and I expect the same in return. English is my second language, and we may have more cultural barriers than we know; I will not take offense from open feedback, but I might miss subtle cues.

Setting expectations, i.e. communicating what's expected of me and what I can expect of you, makes for efficient comms with fewer misunderstandings. This includes telling me how you like your communications!

### When in doubt, overcommunicate
I won't know what you don't tell me about. But please also include why you wanted my attention: is there an action I should take?

I still care, I just need my notes. Please remind me if I forgot a detail :-/

### Informal coffee chats
I'm a fan! Schedule a coffee meeting so we can understand each other better. All free slots in my calendar are fair game. I also welcome meeting in person.

## My working style
I work through making things work, building trust and catalyzing discussions. Grab me for backup, if need be, so:
- Talk to me about technology. While most of the engineering should be done by engineers, I very much enjoy discussing technical issues. I have seen various design patterns work or fail in interesting ways (and on large scale) over the years, and I'm happy to learn something and/or share what I know.
  - Corollary: I will sometimes offer ideas or seem to nitpick while you know better. If you got this and want me to step back, please let me know, no offense will be taken.
- Feel free to book any empty slot on my calendar if you have anything to discuss. Please share me the context or documents for the meeting in advance if things are complicated.
- Feel free to ping me (both DM or mentioning in any channel) for quick discuss, or anything you think it no needs to have a meeting.
- Please use sentences that are short, simple and direct to the point. As mentioned earlier, English is not my native language, so I would like to avoid any misunderstanding while communicating.
- In particular, I usually work from 8:30 +- 30mins to 17:30 +-30mins JST, so feel free to ping me in this time window. Otherwise, it may take some time for me to response you.

## More ways to get in touch
- Feel free to ping me on Slack or any communication channel that I'm on.
- or just drop a message at `#times_dao` channel on Slack. I will get back to you ASAP.
